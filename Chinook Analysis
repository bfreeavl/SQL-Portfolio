#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it titled Customers, Media Types, Genres, Playlist, Playlist Track, Tracks, Artists, Invoices, Invoice Items, 
Albums, and Employees. 

The following queries were performed:

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country<>"USA"

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country="Brazil"

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceID, BillingCountry, InvoiceDate, Country
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE customers.country="Brazil"

4. Show the employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT FirstName, LastName, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title="Sales Support Agent"

5.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT INV.Total, Cust.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName, Cust.LastName AS CustomerLastName, Cust.Country, EMP.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName, EMP.LastName AS EmployeeLastName
FROM chinook.invoices AS INV
JOIN chinook.customers AS Cust
ON cust.CustomerId=INV.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees AS EMP
ON EMP.EmployeeId=Cust.SupportRepID
