#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it titled Customers, Media Types, Genres, Playlist, Playlist Track, Tracks, Artists, Invoices, Invoice Items, 
Albums, and Employees. 

The following queries were performed:

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country<>"USA"
