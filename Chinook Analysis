#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it titled Customers, Media Types, Genres, Playlist, Playlist Track, Tracks, Artists, Invoices, Invoice Items, 
Albums, and Employees. 





1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country<>"USA"
