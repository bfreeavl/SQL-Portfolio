#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it titled Customers, Media Types, Genres, Playlist, Playlist Track, Tracks, Artists, Invoices, Invoice Items, 
Albums, and Employees. 

The following queries were performed:

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country<>"USA";

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country="Brazil";

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceID, BillingCountry, InvoiceDate, Country
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE customers.country="Brazil";

4. Show the employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT FirstName, LastName, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title="Sales Support Agent";

5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices

6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT Emp.FirstName AS SalesAgentFirstName, Emp.LastName AS SalesAgentLastName, Inv.InvoiceId, Inv.Total AS InvoiceTotal
FROM chinook.employees AS Emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS Cus
ON Emp.EmployeeID=Cus.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS Inv
ON Cus.CustomerId=Inv.CustomerId


7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT INV.Total, Cust.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName, Cust.LastName AS CustomerLastName, Cust.Country, EMP.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName, EMP.LastName AS EmployeeLastName
FROM chinook.invoices AS INV
JOIN chinook.customers AS Cust
ON cust.CustomerId=INV.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees AS EMP
ON EMP.EmployeeId=Cust.SupportRepID;

8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) = '2009';

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT employees.FirstName AS EmployeeName, employees.LastName AS EmployeeLastName, SUM(invoice_items.UnitPrice*invoice_items.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN customers
ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId
LEFT JOIN invoices
ON invoices.CustomerId=customers.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN invoice_items
ON invoice_items.InvoiceId=invoices.InvoiceId
GROUP BY employees.EmployeeId
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
