#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM JanSales)
#OR 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Price)) Total_Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(Price) ASC

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select 

SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(Price) Revenue, Location
FROM FebSales
WHERE Location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
